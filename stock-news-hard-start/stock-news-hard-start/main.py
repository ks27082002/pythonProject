## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this: 
"""
